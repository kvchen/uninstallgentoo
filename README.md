Uninstall Gentoo
================

### Description

Uninstall Gentoo is an interactive stream in which users attempt to prove that 2015 is, in fact, the year of the Linux desktop. Anyone in chat can send commands to the current Linux distribution running in the stream and have their commands registered in real time (barring Twitch stream delay).



### Restrictions

Because of the obviously insecure nature of this implementation, a number of restrictions have been put into place to avoid illegal behavior. Logs will be monitored for illegal activity, and users attempting to carry out said activities will be added to a global blacklist.



### Modification

All the code used in running the stream is open-sourced in [this repository](https://github.com/kvchen/uninstallgentoo) and may be used and modified within the bounds of the license (GPLv2).
